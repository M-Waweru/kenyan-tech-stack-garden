# 13. Trust's Dark Twin: Fraud, SIM Swaps, Social Engineering

## Lead

The same rails that made digital money feel effortless also created new attack surfaces.

A **subscriber identity module (SIM)** suddenly goes silent. A spoofed support call follows. Messages arrive confirming transactions the account owner did not authorize. By the time facts are clear, fear has already spread through family groups and business chats.

Trust is therefore not a static asset in Kenya’s payment stack. It is continuously rebuilt. Part III ends here with that burden explicit: security maturity is no longer a staff function bolted onto a “feature-complete” launch—it is part of what people mean when they say a payment “works.”

## Context

As M-PESA and mobile-linked services scaled, fraud evolved from opportunistic theft to **structured social engineering**. **Communications Authority of Kenya (CA)** reporting through **Kenya National Computer Incident Response Team – Coordination Centre (KE-CIRT/CC)** publications documents sustained pressure across abuse types—online abuse, vulnerabilities, malware, and socially engineered compromise—at volumes that read like weather, not anecdotes ([KE-CIRT/CC report Q2 FY2023/24][ca-cirt-q2], [KE-CIRT/CC report Q1 FY2022/23][ca-cirt-q1]).

**One-time passwords (OTPs)** delivered by **short message service (SMS)** knit payment rails to **telecommunications company (telco)** identity. That joint is where many attacks concentrate—developed further in relation to programmable comms in [Africa's Talking](../part-04/14-africas-talking.md).

## History

### Early years: novelty and crude scams

Users learned digital money alongside **phishing** templates that looked laughable in hindsight but worked on first contact. Losses were often small individually; collectively they trained suspicion.

### Growth years: identity as the prize

As balances and **loan** products grew, attackers moved toward **SIM** takeover, **customer support** manipulation, and **authorised push payment** style tricks that exploit urgency and social trust more than broken cryptography.

### Maturity years: law, institutions, and an arms race

The **Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, 2018** and the **Data Protection Act, 2019** gave prosecutors and **data** regulators clearer language for offences and obligations ([Cybercrimes Act][cyber-act], [Data Protection Act][dpa]). Platforms hardened controls; users absorbed more **friction**. The fight is ongoing because incentives favour attackers who only need one lucky seam.

## Product and mechanics

### Composite scene: when the line goes dead

*Composite, grounded in public cybercrime reporting and typical institutional response patterns:* A user loses network without travelling, sees prompts that do not match ordinary updates, then notices deductions or confirmations they did not authorize. Fear moves through family chats faster than facts. In the days that follow, the story splinters between telco support queues, reversal paperwork, and police Occurrence Book culture—while product and fraud teams replay logs to see where process, not cryptography, failed. The episode is analysed here as infrastructure behaviour, not as a DIY recovery manual.

SIM-swap and social-engineering paths usually exploit **identity reset** seams, **support-channel** manipulation, **credential** takeover, rapid **transfer** attempts, and **delayed** user awareness. Defences are **socio-technical**: stronger identity controls, operator **fraud** desks, anomaly detection, and incident response that treats customer harm as a first-class metric—not only a ticket count.

## Business model and incentives

Fraud imposes direct loss and indirect **trust** loss; the second often costs more. For platforms and integrators, **anti-fraud** spend is not optional overhead if they want repeat transaction velocity.

## Regulation and referees

### Referee beat — from statute to support script

Statutes set the perimeter; users meet **referees** as **SIM** replacement policies, **OTP** throttles, and **bank**–**telco** coordination when a line is compromised. The regulatory challenge is operational: fast detection, evidence preservation, and recovery paths that do not punish victims twice with bureaucracy.

## Adoption in Kenya

Adoption persisted because utility stayed high, but behaviour changed: caution about unsolicited calls, reluctance to read **OTP**s aloud, and preference for official apps and channels. **Security literacy** became part of **digital literacy**—unevenly distributed, like every other literacy.

## Ecosystem effects

Merchants and platforms pay higher **support** costs after major fraud waves. **Onboarding** friction rises for everyone when **KYC** tightens in response. High-risk segments see slower conversion. A parallel market of **fraud tooling**, **compliance** services, and **identity** products grows—security as industry, not only as feature flag.

## Setbacks and controversies

Convenience gains are socialised while **vigilance** labour is often individualised—a fairness tension users feel acutely. Platform enforcement choices (what to block, what to label) become de facto governance for huge swaths of public life.

## Competition and alternatives

No rail is fraud-proof; attackers follow **value density** and weak **process** controls. **Trust competition** will increasingly be won on **recovery**: speed, clarity, and perceived fairness when something breaks.

## Legacy and open questions

Kenya’s payment success cannot be separated from its **trust-and-safety** burden. Open questions include **cross-platform** fraud intelligence sharing, stronger **identity** standards that still include informal workers, and how to lower user vigilance load without raising systemic risk.

## Builder read

*Interpretation.* Do not treat anti-fraud as a compliance team’s job after launch.

Design your product so suspicious events are explainable, recoverable, and reversible within user-friendly timelines. Trust is rebuilt operationally, not rhetorically.
